# PGIMRI

**PGIMRI** is a wrapper package for Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) for several projects I did at PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. This code is based on data from Philips Ingenia 3T MRI Scanner. This code might not work out of the box but you can use it as a reference if you are working on similar images.
